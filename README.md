# Graphical Standings Tool

## How to use

1. Open GSTool.xlsx in **Google Sheets** or copy [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I9_BK0mRxmFbrwqNiVRuNp9YkeES9nu_ODH-BhTA8sc/copy) (note: I can't guarantee this will work on Microsoft Excel at all, sorry).
2. Enter league data (follow instructions in the spreadsheet) and export as .xlsx.
3. Use RStudio (or text editor of choice) to produce graphics from exported data.

## Example
1. I entered data for the new PWHL season in Google Sheets, and exported as GSTool_PWHL202425.xlsx.
2. I made a copy of GS_Production.R, called GS_Prod_PWHL202425.R, and edited settings to produce an output at ./Outputs/PWHL/PWHL202425_W01.png.

You can run GS_Prod_PWHL202425.R for yourself to see how this program works.
